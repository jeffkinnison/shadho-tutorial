# First Example: Optimizing sin(x)

This example demonstrates how to set up a basic minimization of
`sin(x) * cos(y)` with `x ~ U(0, 2pi)` and `y ~ U(0, 2pi)`.

## Instructions

To run the example, load an environment with SHADHO installed, then in the
terminal run

```
python3 driver.py
```

This will run the SHADHO driver for 30 seconds then print the optimal
hyperparameters to screen and load a contour plot of the evaluations.
